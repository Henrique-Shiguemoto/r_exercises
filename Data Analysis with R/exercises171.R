# 5 - Create a bar graph that shows the distribution of the price

# 6 - Two useful aesthetics for bar graphs are color and fill. 
# For your bar graph from Exercise 1 above, try mapping cut to color
# and then to fill. Which seems to be the more helpful aesthetic?

# The fill aesthetic is definitely better because it separates cut 
# categories per bar more clearly than the colour aesthetic.

# 7 - A more useful way to apply the color or fill aesthetics is to
# pair them with the optional position argument. Run the following 
# code and reflect on how the bar graph might be better than the ones
# from Exercise 6.

# On the previous visualization I noticed that it wasn't clear that the 
# other categories followed a normal distribution just like the "Ideal"
# category, with the position parameter set to dodge, it is now very clear
# that the conjecture is actually true for all categories of cut. 
# Very cool!

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = clarity, fill = cut), position = "dodge")

# 8 - Explain why the following code would produce a bar graph that would 
# contain some redundancy but would also be visually pleasing:

# The fill parameter is unnecessary because we already have the information
# on the x axis legends about what each column represents. On the other 
# hand, the redundancy that the color parameter brings makes the 
# visualization more pleasing to see and also highlights the 
# differentiation of the columns.

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut))

# 9 - Reproduce the bar graph from the previous problem, but add an
# extra layer:+ coord_polar(). What happens?

# Now the graph isn't a bar graph anymore, it is a pie chart? sort of? 
# Idk how to call it. Each bar is now a piece of the pie with a color
# differentiation and also the length of the pie in height and angle is
# more information redundancy for column differentiation. I don't think
# this layer is necessary.

# 10 - Create a visualization of the distribution of the manufacturer
# variable in mpg. Explain why this visualization would look better if
# the bars were displayed horizontally rather than vertically, then 
# create such a visualization. (Hint: Recall how this is done for box
# plots.)

# It is better vertically because the labels for each column don't overlap
# each other.

    coord_flip()

# 11 - The aesthetics for geom_histogram are the same as those for
# geom_bar. Create a histogram that shows the distribution of carat
# within diamonds and use an aesthetic to show the distribution of cut
# values within each bin.

# 12 - A geom very similar to geom_histogram is geom_freqpoly. Create
# a visualization of the distribution of price within diamonds using 
# geom_freqpoly instead of geom_histogram. Why might this sometimes be
# preferable to a histogram?

# It sort of has almost the same amount of information as a histrogram
# but with less things in the viz. It also shows the same trends you'd
# see in a histogram but with less visuals, which means you can fit
# more visuals with it.

# 13 - As you may have seen in Exercise 11, you can map a third 
# variable to the color or fill aesthetic, but the result is somewhat
# visually confusing. Retry Exercise 11, but use geom_freqpoly rather
# than geom_histogram. Do you think this is a better visualization?
